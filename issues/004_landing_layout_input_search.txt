Title: The landing input to search for spreadsheet or hashcode
Assigned to: Mohnish
Description: non-(alphanumeric or space) characters should not be accepted and an alert should be displayed for the user. The form should not submit. The form currently submits.

Solution: I added a red var to ensure that the input does not have any other symbols. This code fixes the problem.
var reg = /[^A-Za-z0-9 ]/;
if(!input.match(reg)){
}
